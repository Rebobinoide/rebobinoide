Rebobinoide 
===========
The project revolves around a modified Yamaha whose pads have been wired for external activation - as opposed to triggering by hitting - through a female VGA connector.

## Arduino

Each of the 4 (four) pads is independently wired to be triggered by OUTPUT pins 10 through 13 following a sequencer pattern stored in the Arduino. The sequencer in turn is triggered by INPUT pins A0 through A5.
